Description:  alfred is a user space daemon for distributing arbitrary local information
 over the mesh/network in a decentralized fashion. This data can be anything
 which appears to be useful - originally designed to replace the batman-adv
 visualization (vis), you may distribute hostnames, phone books, administration
 information, DNS information, the local weather forecast ...
 
 alfred runs as daemon in the background of the system. A user may insert
 information by using the alfred binary on the command line, or use special
 programs to communicate with alfred (done via unix sockets). alfred then takes
 care of distributing the local information to other alfred servers on other
 nodes. This is done via IPv6 link-local multicast, and does not require any
 configuration. A user can request data from alfred, and will receive the
 information available from all alfred servers in the network.

Description:  The Go programming language is an open source project to make
 programmers more productive.
 
 Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency
 mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of
 multicore and networked machines, while its novel type system enables
 flexible and modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to
 machine code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power
 of run-time reflection. It's a fast, statically typed, compiled language
 that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language.
 
 This package provides the Go programming language source files needed
 for cross-compilation.

Description:  gpsd is a userland daemon acting as a translator between GPS and AIS receivers

 binary, Rockwell binary, Garmin binary format, or other vendor binary
 protocols.  gpsd takes this information from the GPS and translates it into
 something uniform and easier to understand for clients.
 This package contains auxiliary tools and example clients for monitoring and
 testing the GPS daemon.

 The libavahi package contains the mDNS/DNS-SD shared libraries,
 used by other programs. Specifically, it provides
 libavahi-core and libavahi-common libraries.
 .
 The libavahi-dbus-support package enables
 D-Bus support in avahi, needed to support
 the libavahi-client library and avahi-utils.
 .
 Selecting this package modifies the build configuration
 so that avahi packages are built with support for D-BUS enabled;
 it does not generate a separate binary of its own.
 It also automatically adds the D-Bus package to the build.
 libavahi-dbus-support is selected automatically if you select
 libavahi-client or avahi-utils.
